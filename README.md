# unicodecam

This package provides tools to take "pictures" and "video" consisting of Unicode characters.

## Motivation

I am a big fan of the annual Advent of Code challenges. This year, on Day 12, there was a puzzle in which the task was to program a pathfinding algorithm. I used this challenge to work intensively with different pathfinding algorithms.  While working on the problem, I kept using terminal outputs to visualize the algorithms. However, this slowed down the algorithm tremendously and the display also flickered a lot because the terminal could not keep up.  
Now at the end of the year, after the event for 2022 has ended, I had the idea to "record" the visualizations while the program is running and render them afterwards at any speed with the help of curses.  
I want to create this tool for simple visualizations, like they might come up in an Advent of Code challenge. Maybe some time, I might even make it compatible with curses, to record the screen while playing a game...
