# Contributing to unicodecam

There is not too much to do in this project and what needs to be done, I do myself. If external help is needed, the issue is marked with the tag `external help wanted`.

### If you work on the code, please:
- describe in the PR what changes you have made and keep it to those only
- don't re-format the code
- stick to [these](https://gist.github.com/MarcDiethelm/7303312) contribution guidelines as good as you can.

Thank you.
